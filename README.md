# Obesity ML Project


## Project Overview
This project focuses on preprocessing a dataset to transform categorical variables into numeric format, calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) from height and weight measurements, and analyze the correlation between various factors and obesity levels. The goal is to identify patterns and insights related to obesity, including outlier detection based on BMI and comparison of expected vs. actual obesity categories.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on individuals, including their physical measurements (height, weight), dietary habits, lifestyle choices, and transportation modes. Key columns include:
* Gender: Male or Female
* Height: in meters (m)
* Weight: in kilograms (kg)
* family_history_with_overweight: yes or no
* FAVC: Frequent consumption of high caloric food (yes or no)
* SMOKE: Smoking (yes or no)
* SCC: Calories consumption monitoring (yes or no)
* CAEC: Consumption of food between meals
* CALC: Consumption of alcohol
* MTRANS: Mode of transportation
* NObeyesdad: Obesity level classification

Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

To install the required Python libraries, run:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
